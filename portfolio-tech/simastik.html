                    The University Asset Information System named <b>SIMASTIK (Sistem Informasi Manajemen Aset dan Logistik)</b> is a web-based platform built to help the university's asset management department (Biro Pengelolaan Aset dan Usaha / BPAU) manage their asset data more efficiently. The goal was to rebuild and modernize a legacy system previously developed by a government agency into a custom application tailored to the university's needs. My responsibilities included building API endpoints for various reports and dashboards, optimizing and maintaining existing features, and assisting user manual documentation.

    <h4>My Role as Backend Intern</h4>
    <div class="row mb-5">
        <div class="col-12">
            <p>
                During my two-month internship, I was responsible to build and maintain RESTful API endpoints that powered various reporting and dashboard features. I worked with Laravel 8 (PHP) and MySQL, collaborating in a small team consisting of a fullstack intern and a project lead, with source control managed through GitLab.
            </p>
            <p>
                I was directly involved in creating multiple API endpoints, such as one that generated categorized asset reports, which provided detailed information on asset value, classification, and status. Another key feature I built was an endpoint to calculate total maintenance costs and asset depreciation. In building these endpoints, I focused on writing clean and optimized queries to ensure fast and reliable responses, while also aligning the API outputs with frontend requirements through close communication with the team.

        <div class="col-12">
            <p>
                Beyond development tasks, I also participated in drafting a user manual to guide non-technical stakeholders in using the final system, making the platform more accessible to end users.
            </p>
            <p>
                One of the biggest challenges I encountered was the lack of technical documentation, which made it difficult to understand the business logic and data flow. To overcome this, I actively asked questions, kept a personal logbook to map key terms and system processes, and gradually built a mental model of how the system was supposed to work. This process significantly improved my ability to read legacy code and transform abstract requirements into working features.
