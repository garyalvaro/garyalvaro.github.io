            <p>
                This web application was requested by the client to digitize the clinic's administrative tasks, which were mostly still handled manually—such as recording dental treatments, calculating treatment fees, tracking patient payments, and more. The clinic had previously used a desktop application for basic patient data management, but it lacked a user-friendly interface and comprehensive features. A web-based system was recommended to the client due to its ease of use and accessibility without requiring technical expertise.

            <h4>Planning</h4>
            <p>
                The goal of this application was to help the clinic owner and head nurse efficiently digitize their administrative operations, as many processes were still manually documented.
            </p>
            <p>
                The system scope includes patient registration, medical records, dental treatments and their respective fees, payment tracking, receipt generation, X-ray management, simple procurement features, dashboard, and various operational reports. The system is web-based and accessible via browser. At the client's request, the system is deployed on a local offline server to restrict access to the local network only.
            </p>
            <p>
                The project involved two primary users (the clinic owner and head nurse) and one full-stack developer—myself.

            <h4>Analysis</h4>
            <p>
                The clinic previously used a desktop application that stored only basic patient information such as name, registration number, address, and phone number. It lacked the ability to support administrative tasks like recording dental treatments, payment tracking, and generating operational reports. These tasks were still performed manually in logbooks.
            </p>
            <p>
                This new application was developed to help the clinic owner monitor clinic operations digitally and assist the head nurse in recording and organizing patient data, treatment records, payment logs, X-ray data, and supply purchases.

            <h4>Design</h4>
            <p>
                The system design began by identifying all necessary database fields and drafting rough sketches based on the defined requirements. A low-fidelity user interface was created to allow faster iteration and feedback collection from users.
            </p>
            <p>
                For more complex processes, workflow diagrams were created to better understand the clinic's business processes. Once the workflows were clear, the database schema and table relationships were designed, followed by defining the system modules.

            <h4>Implementation</h4>
            <p>
                The system was developed using the Laravel framework (PHP) and connected to a MySQL database. The user interface utilized a premium admin template based on Bootstrap 4 and jQuery 3. Development tools included Visual Studio Code, TablePlus for managing the database, and Laragon for the local web server environment.
            </p>
            <p>
                Development was handled independently and done modularly, starting with account/login features, followed by patient registration, and so on. All changes were tracked using GitHub as the version control system. A custom feature was added to the local server setup to fetch updates from the Git repository.
            </p>
            <p>
                After feature development was completed, data from the previous Microsoft SQL Server-based system was extracted and imported into the new application's database, with column names adjusted as needed.
            </p>
        </div>

            <h4>Testing</h4>
            <p>
                Manual testing was conducted using various test cases to ensure that each system function aligned with the designed business processes. Any bugs identified were fixed immediately. User testing was performed directly after the system was deployed.
            </p>
        </div>

    <div class="row mb-5">
        <div class="col-12">
            <h4>Deployment / Release</h4>
            <p>
                The system was deployed locally by installing Laragon as the web server on the clinic's main computer, configured to launch automatically when the computer starts. Git was installed to fetch the source code from GitHub. Once the code was imported, environment configuration and database migration were carried out using Laravel’s migration feature. 
            </p>
            <p>
                A training session was conducted for the users after deployment. Each feature was demonstrated and explained thoroughly to ensure users could operate the system confidently and provide valuable feedback.

            <h4>Maintenance</h4>
            <p>
                Ongoing maintenance continues to this day, primarily to respond to user inquiries and requests for minor feature enhancements that improve operational efficiency. Bug fixes are handled promptly via remote access using AnyDesk.
